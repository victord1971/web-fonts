        Welcome to the very start of your React Native journey! 
        If you're looking for environment setup instructions, 
        they've moved to their own section. 
        Continue reading for an introduction to the documentation, 
        Native Components, React, and more!

        React Native is an open source framework for building 
        Android and iOS applications using React and 
        the app platform’s native capabiles. 
        With React Native, you use JavaScript to access 
        your platform’s APIs as well as to describe 
        the appearance and behavior of your UI using React components: 
        bundles of reusable, nestable code. 
        You can learn more about React in the next section. 
        But first, let’s cover how components work in React Native.

        React Native runs on React, a popular open source library 
        for building user interfaces with JavaScript. 
        To make the most of React Native, 
        it helps to understand React itself. 
        This section can get you started or can serve as a refresher course.
      </p>
      <p>
        We’re going to cover the core concepts behind React:
      </p>  
      <p>
        + components. The rest of this introduction to React 
        uses cats in its examples: friendly, 
        approachable creatures that need names and a cafe to work in.
      </p>  
      <p>
        + JSX. React and React Native use JSX, 
        a syntax that lets you write elements inside JavaScript like so:  
        &ltText&gtHello, I am your cat!&lt/Text&gt.
      </p>
      <p>
        The React docs have a comprehensive guide to JSX you can refer 
        to learn even more. Because JSX is JavaScript, 
        you can use variables inside it. 
        Here you are declaring a name for the cat, name, 
        and embedding it with curly braces inside &ltText&gt&lt/Text&gt
      </p>

      <p>
        + props. Props is short for “properties”. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <b>+ state.</b> While you can think of props as arguments you use 
        to configure how components render, state is like a component’s 
        personal data storage. State is useful for handling data 
        that changes over time or that comes from user interaction. 
        State gives your components memory!
